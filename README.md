# thvm
A 16-bit virtual machine with cooperative multi-tasking, paging, and more.

## Goals
* This is an educational project.
* Design a 16-bit instruction set.
* Implement a virtual machine that implements the aforementioned instruction set.
* Eventually JIT-compile this bytecode to x86/x86_64?

## Documentation
* [Complete Machine Specification](docs/thvm.spec)
* [Assembler](docs/thasm.md)
